A simple demonstration of an interacting between the browser and a EOS blockchain. The demo uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [EOS.js](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosjs).

## Getting started

- Get the code: `git clone repo && cd repo/frontend`
- Download/install dependencies: `npm install`
- Modify `const config` in the `src/index.jsx` file.
- Start it up: `npm start`, then open `http://localhost:8080/` to try it out.
